Day Two
Lists and strings , loops
Count vowels in a string, every letter in the english alphabet is either a
vowel or consonant, [a, e, i, o, u] is a list of all vowels. The rest are all
considered consonants. Write a function that takes a string and returns a
tuple containing a new string made of all and only the vowels from the
original string and the number of duplicates in the original string. Only the
first instance of the vowel is considered.
For example:
countVowels(‘dahdah’) # will return (‘a’, 3)
countVowels(‘drink water’) # will return (‘iae’, 0)
Python programming challenge : Fizzbuzz , (lists and conditional
logical)
Write a function named Fizzbuzz that takes two(2) lists and returns Fizz if
the combined length of the lists is divisible by 3, Buzz if it is divisible by 5,
Fizzbuzz if it is divisible by both 5 and 3 or the combined length of the list.
For example:
fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [ ]) # will return “fizz”
fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [1, 2]) # will return “buzz”
fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [1]) # will return 4
